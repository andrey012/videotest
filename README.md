# videotest

This is small extension over Yii CWebTestCase to enable some nice animation features for functional tests.

These features should be useful for recording videos on Continuous Integration servers. These videos can be used as acceptance materials or for teaching users/testers/other developers. 

Some examples on video effects, that can be created using this extension can be found at https://github.com/andrey012/videotestresults

For examples on usage of this extension - see https://github.com/andrey012/videotestsandbox and particularly /protected/tests/functional/SiteTest.php and /protected/tests/WebTestCase.php
